# 23 统计各科成绩各分数段人数：课程编号，课程名名称，[100-85]、[85-70]、[70-60]、[0-60]及其所占比

## SQL

```sql
select 
	sc.c_id,
	c_name,
	a.`85-100`,
	a.`85-100百分比`,
	b.`70-85`,
	b.`70-85百分比`,
	c.`60-70`,
	c.`60-70百分比`,
	d.`0-60`,
	d.`0-60百分比`
from (select c_id from sc group by sc.c_id) as sc
left join (
	select
		c_id,
		sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end) as `85-100`,
		(100 * (sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `85-100百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as a on sc.c_id = a.c_id
left join (
	select
		c_id,
		sum(case when score > 70 and score <= 85 then 1 else 0 end) as `70-85`,
		(100 * (sum(case when score > 70 and score <= 85 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `70-85百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as b on sc.c_id = b.c_id
left join (
	select
		c_id,
		sum(case when score > 60 and score <= 70 then 1 else 0 end) as `60-70`,
		(100 * (sum(case when score > 60 and score <= 70 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `60-70百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as c on sc.c_id = c.c_id
left join (
	select
		c_id,
		sum(case when score >= 0 and score <= 60 then 1 else 0 end) as `0-60`,
		(100 * (sum(case when score >= 0 and score <= 60 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `0-60百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as d on sc.c_id = d.c_id
left join course on d.c_id = course.c_id
```

## 解析

- 使用 `sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end)` 查出各个分数段的人数
- 使用 `sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*)`   查出各个分数段的人数占总人数的百分比
- 使用 `left join` 将各个分数段的查询结果连接起来
- 对 `sc` 表按照 `c_id` 分组可以去掉重复的课程

	distinct

	d.`0-60百分比`
from sc 
left join (
	select

		from sc group by c_id

left join (
	select

		(100 * (sum(case when score > 70 and score <= 85 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `70-85百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as b on sc.c_id = b.c_id
left join (

		(100 * (sum(case when score > 60 and score <= 70 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*))) as `60-70百分比`
		from sc group by c_id
) as c on sc.c_id = c.c_id
left join (
	select

left join course on d.c_id = course.c_id

## 解析

- 使用 `sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end)` 查出各个分数段的人数
- 使用 `sum(case when score > 85 and score <= 100 then 1 else 0 end) / count(*)`   查出各个分数段的人数占总人数的百分比
- 使用 `left join` 将各个分数段的查询结果连接起来
- 最后在和 `sc` 、 `course` 表连接起来，使用 `distinct` 去掉重复的
