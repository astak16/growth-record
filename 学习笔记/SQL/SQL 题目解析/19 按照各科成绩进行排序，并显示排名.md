# 19 按照各科成绩进行排序，并显示排名

## SQL

```sql
select 
	a.s_id, 
	a.c_id,
	@i:=@i + 1 as i保留排名,
	@k:=(case when @score=a.score then @k else @i end) as rank不保留排名,
	@score:=a.score as score
from (
	select s_id, c_id, score from sc 
	group by s_id, c_id, score 
	order by score desc
) as a, (select @i:=0, @k:=0, @score:=0) as init;
```

## 解析

- `select name, @i=:@i+1 as 顺序 from table, (select @i:=1) as int`
    - `@i:=1` 是初始值

| name | 顺序 |
| --- | --- |
| zhangsan | 1 |
| lisi | 2 |
| wangwu | 3 |
| zhaoliu | 4 |
